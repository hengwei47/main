## Projects
### Mathematica
- 1.Tower of Hanoi: Made a programme that can visualize the solution of Tower of Hanoi.  
汉诺塔：又称河内塔, 是一个起源于印度的益智玩具。传说是梵天创世时, 做了三根金刚柱, 在第一根柱子上从下往上按大小顺序放上64片黄金圆盘, 梵天命婆罗门从圆盘下面开始按大小顺序重新摆放到第三根柱子上, 并规定, 小圆盘上不能放大圆盘, 三根柱子之间一次只能移动一个圆盘。随后, 僧侣们预言, 当所有金片从第一根转移到最后一根上时, 便是世界末日之时。Mathematica程序实现了其可视化。
- 2.Mars Retrograde: Made a programme that can visualize the Mar Retrograde and the moving of Earth and Mars in the different view.  
Mars retrograde is an astronomical phenomenon in which Mars appears to move backward (from east to west) in the night sky relative to the background stars. This apparent reversal is not due to Mars physically changing direction, but rather results from the relative positions and motions of Earth and Mars in their respective orbits.  
Because Earth orbits the Sun faster than Mars, there are times when Earth overtakes Mars. During this period, known as retrograde motion, Mars seems to slow down, stop, and move westward temporarily before resuming its normal eastward (prograde) path. Mars retrograde occurs roughly every 26 months and lasts for about 2 to 2.5 months.  
This phenomenon has been observed since ancient times and was historically difficult to explain before the heliocentric model of the solar system was widely accepted.
