# Mars Retrograde（火星视逆行）
Mars retrograde is an astronomical phenomenon in which Mars appears to move backward (from east to west) in the night sky relative to the background stars. This apparent reversal is not due to Mars physically changing direction, but rather results from the relative positions and motions of Earth and Mars in their respective orbits.  
Because Earth orbits the Sun faster than Mars, there are times when Earth overtakes Mars. During this period, known as retrograde motion, Mars seems to slow down, stop, and move westward temporarily before resuming its normal eastward (prograde) path. Mars retrograde occurs roughly every 26 months and lasts for about 2 to 2.5 months.  
This phenomenon has been observed since ancient times and was historically difficult to explain before the heliocentric model of the solar system was widely accepted.  
I design a programme that can visualize the Mars Retrograde in Mathematica.
